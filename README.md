# Project Title: House Price Prediction
# Objective:
To predict house prices using the Boston Housing dataset by applying machine learning models and performing data analysis to identify influential factors affecting prices.

# Dataset:
The Boston Housing dataset (Boston.csv) includes attributes like crime rate, number of rooms, property tax, and more to help predict house prices.

# Implementation:
# Data Pre-processing:

Handled missing or incorrect data.
Scaled and normalized features for optimal model performance.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized relationships between features and house prices using plots and statistical summaries.
Analyzed key factors impacting house prices, such as location, size, and crime rate.

# Model Development:

Applied regression algorithms to predict house prices.
Fine-tuned models to improve accuracy and reduce errors.
Evaluation:

Assessed model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.

# Files in Repository:

# Technologies Used:
Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
